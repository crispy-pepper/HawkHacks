# Pew Pew Pose: Hawk Hack <br>

## Part 1: Software 
### How does it work? <br>
Pose generator works by taking a camera capture of the screen and processing it with the object <code>Pose</code> from mediapipe. An image is created with a segmentation mask overlay of the human subject. The inside of the subject is rewritten to black while everything else is white. This segmented image is saved as a pose.
